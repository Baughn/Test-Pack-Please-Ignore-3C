# Mod manifest builder

The .json-manifest files are autogenerated and should not be edited by hand.

After changing a .json file, or to update mod versions, run ./update.py. 
This will also (once implemented) update the mod list in the top-level directory.

On Nix/NixOS update.py will auto-install its dependencies. If you do not have Nix installed, you can:
- (a) [Install it](https://nixos.org/nix/). You will need to be running Linux.
- (b) Manually install the dependencies and explicitly call python. Something like this might work:
~~~~
$ sudo apt-get install python-beautifulsoup python-lxml python-futures python-progressbar
$ python update.py
~~~~
However, you will need Nix to use the repository's other functions.
